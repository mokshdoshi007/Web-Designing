      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I have always had an interest in computer science from a young age. When I was in 3rd Grade I
  used to go to my school library to read books related to HTML for learning the language and the
    art of making websites. A year later when my elder sister entered high school and was learning
  JAVA with her tuition teacher, I always used to sit beside them. Although I couldnâ€™t understand
  the theoretical aspects at that age, I managed to learn how to code and make programs which
  could be used at a bank, restaurant or a mall. The Banking program which I made in 5th grade
  was highly appreciated and I had submitted it for my 12th Board Examinations.
  As I grew up, I enhanced my theoretical knowledge and scored a perfect 100 in computer
  science in both the board exams which strengthened my belief that I would be successful in
  pursuing the career I have chosen. I went on to complete certified courses in Java, Python, Android and Web Development providing me an all-round knowledge in the field.
  In future I wish to learn ethical hacking and IOT which are growing and vital sectors.
